# Dungeon Quad (C++)

This is a recreation of the game [Dungeon Quad](https://github.com/BardiaTiM/project-dungeon-quad), originally written in Java, in C++.

## How to run

Run `main.cpp` in the `src` folder.

## Setting up SFML

I only have the tutorial on MacOS with CLion (Homebrew) [here](https://dev.to/giovannicodes/sfml-2-5-1-setup-on-macos-with-clion-505m).
