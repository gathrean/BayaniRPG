# Bayani RPG

At first, this project aimed to recreate the essence of [Dungeon Quad](https://github.com/BardiaTiM/project-dungeon-quad), a game originally coded in Java, but took a different direction.

Instead of a side-scroller game where the enemies spawn and shoot at the player, this game is a semi open-world game where the player can roam freely while enemies follow the player and attack when in range.

## How to run

Run `main.cpp` in the `src` folder.

## Setting up SFML

I only have the tutorial on MacOS with CLion (Homebrew) [here](https://dev.to/giovannicodes/sfml-2-5-1-setup-on-macos-with-clion-505m).
